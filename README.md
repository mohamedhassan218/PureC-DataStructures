# Data Structures with C

## About

Welcome to my Data Structures in C repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of essential data structures, all implemented from scratch using the C programming language. As a passionate computer science student, I have meticulously crafted each data structure to gain a deeper understanding of low-level concepts and to improve my coding skills.

By building these data structures from the ground up, I've focused on efficiency, clarity, and adherence to best practices in C programming. Each implementation is accompanied by detailed comments and explanations to make it easy to follow and understand.

Whether you're a fellow student, an educator, or a developer looking to brush up on your C skills, I hope you find this repository helpful and insightful. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.

Happy coding!
